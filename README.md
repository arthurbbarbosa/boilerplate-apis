# Templates for APIs in Elixir, Rust and Javascript
This project consists of three apis templates built in rust, elixir and javascript (the languages I master) for future projects.

All the apis always run on port 3000 and can be accessed at `localhost:3000`.

The [Rust](/rust/) API was written using [Actix_Web](https://actix.rs).<br />
The [Elixir](/elixir/) API was written using [Bandit](https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit).<br />
The [Javascript](/javascript/) API was written using [UWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js).

## Benchmark
- [Rust](/rust/) Render Time: **1.2µs** / **0.0012ms**
- [Javascript](/javascript/) Render Time: **890µs** / **0.89ms**
- [Elixir](/elixir/) Render Time: **1000µs** / **1ms**
